Campus Maps was our final project in Amador’s Advanced Computer Science class. It is a navigation tool designed to help Amador Valley High School students quickly locate their classrooms. We implemented Dijkstra’s Algorithm, 
ensuring the program could calculate the fastest and most efficient path between any two classrooms on campus.

In addition to the algorithm, we developed a user-friendly interface that presents directions both as a list of classrooms to pass and as a live map with the optimal route highlighted.
